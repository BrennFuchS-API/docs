# Preparing Environment

In order to start making mods, you may grab a .NET IDE. In this tutorial, we will use a free [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

## Installing Visual Studio & Configuration

Please download and install [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). Please follow the instructions, until you reach screen below:

On that screen, you must select following items:

- **.NET destkop development**
- **Game development with Unity**

After that, go to "**Individual components**" tab, and here, make sure that "**.NET Framework 3.5 development tools**" is selected.

After that, you press "**Install**" in the bottom right corner.

After you're done, it is possible that you may need to install .NET Framework 3.5. In order to do that, please refer to [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/dotnet-35-windows-10).

## Adding project template

Next step after you successfully installed Visual Studio, is to add mod project template.

You can download it [right there](_downloads/msc_mod_loader_mod_template.vsix).

When the download has finished, double-click on the file. This will open a window that looks like this:

Click "Install", in order to apply the changes.

## It's done!

If you are done, you can move on to the next page ðŸ˜„
