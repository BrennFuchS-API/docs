# Preparing Environment

In order to start making mods, you may grab a .NET IDE. In this tutorial, we will use a free [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

## Installing Visual Studio & Configuration

Please download and install [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). Please follow the instructions, until you reach screen below:

![tut_1](/PreparingEnvironment/Media/1.png)

On that screen, you must select following items:

- **.NET destkop development**
- **Game development with Unity**

After that, go to "**Individual components**" tab, and here, make sure that "**.NET Framework 3.5 development tools**" is selected.

After that, you press "**Install**" in the bottom right corner.

After you're done, it is possible that you may need to install .NET Framework 3.5. In order to do that, please refer to [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/dotnet-35-windows-10).

## Adding developer tools & resources

Next step after you successfully installed Visual Studio, is to add mod project template and other resources.

The easiest way to do it is to use Installer. Download installer from [the download page](/Download.md) and install the Mod Loader Pro as per usual. On the last page, click "**Install Dev Tools**".

Choose items that you would like to install.

### Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Template (recommended)

A mod template for Microsoft Visual Studio - highly recommended, will make your life much easier. After it finished downloading, it will launch a template installer.

### Unity Template

Contains a starting template for a car mod, including physic materials. After downloading, you can find it inside of My Summer Car folder in `MSCTemplateProject` folder.

### Debugger

Contains a tool that makes it easier to debug mods (such as by showing exact line of code an error has occured). See [creating a new mod](/ForCreators/CreatingANewMod.md) to see more.
